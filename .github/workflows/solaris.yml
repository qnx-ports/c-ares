          #  - We need to max out at v1.13.x because this solaris VM is old and
          #    only has cmake 3.9
          #  - We have to compile google test ourselves because it isn't available.
          #  - We have to forcibly compile google test without threading because
          #    solaris throws an exception for some unknown reason.
          #  - The forcible threading disablement doesn't appear to propagate to
          #    proper cflags with compiling c-ares tests so we need to set a
          #    CXX flag to let google test know it was compiled without threading.
